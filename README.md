# FibrousSystem
This sketch uses an agent system to simulate fibrous system, but it can be used to approximate a lot of different behaviours and tasks, like path finding, stigmergy etc.. In the sketch you'll find the main rules i used for this video : https://vimeo.com/45254456 . You can take a look at the code here : http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/126240 .
